  Hey there! I'm RaphaÃ«l, a senior software engineer specialized in the big data space.
</p>

Currently working at [Ippon USA](www.ipponusa.com), I'm interested in various fields of computer science.
I've done a lot of Java development, scaled a few applications and I am now playing with Scala, Spark and big data technologies.

Previously I was a software engineer in the amazing tech team of [Les Furets.com](www.lesfurets.com) where I have _continuously_ delivered the website and migrated
the storage system from MySQL to Cassandra.

I'm a regular speaker at Devoxx and local meetups.

I'm French and have recently moved to the nice city of Washington, DC.
