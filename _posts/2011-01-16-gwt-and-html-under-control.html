<p>In the past weeks I've seen two articles about making clean design with GWT. That was really interesting, but something still stugling me a lot. Both authors agreed not to use  layout widgets provided by GWT to build UI neither UiBinder but use instead a big ugly static String to store an HTML code/</p>
<p>Take a closer look at those two articles and come back later to find out a better way to improve your design based on GWT.</p>
<p><a href="http://i-proving.ca/space/Technologies/GWT/Lightweight+GWT+layouts">Lightweight GWT layouts</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zackgrossbart.com/hackito/tags-first-gwt/">Tags first GWT</a></p>
<p>
The purpose is to write a clean HTML with the least number of tags and have that HTML code under control with only CSS. I do agree that using the old GWT layout system is a really mess producing a lot of tables and ugly code.<br />
However, since GWT 2.0, Google brought us <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions/gwt-ui-overhaul.html">a better layout system</a> with the widgets positionned using only div and css. With this system you can normally reach a clean design without generating table tags and a lof HTML mess.</p>
<p>
But since the web is all about simple html and css, I agree with Zack Grossbart that you need to have a perfect control of your UI with the least html tags and just css.</p>
<p>But with the version 2.0 GWT also introduces a wonderful feature called UiBinder. With UiBinder you can describe in a declarative way your design separated from your logic. You can especially use the HtmlPanel panel to mix up classic HTML/CSS and GWT widgets. This is exactly what they wanted to do ! Use classic HTML and CSS to describe the UI and GWT only for the control. By using UiBinder they can take advantage of a powerfull tool having a built-in feature to bind GWT widgets from the xml to the Java and many mores.</p>
<p>Putting your html within a static String is not really that clean and maintainable. So please, for God sake, do not do it ! <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/fr/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinder.html">Learn the API</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html#GWT">follow the best practices</a>.<br />
<br />
[update] I've now coded a rewrite of the wordpress login page example just by using UiBinder and the HtmlPanel, see <a href="./wordpress-login-form-with-gwt-and-uibinder/">this post</a>.</p>
